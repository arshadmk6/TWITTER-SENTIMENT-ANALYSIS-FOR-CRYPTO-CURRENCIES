# TWITTER-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-FOR-CRYPTO-CURRENCIES
## Introduction
Twitter has become a popular platform for users to express their thoughts and opinions on various topics, including cryptocurrencies. This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to Ethereum, a popular cryptocurrency, to understand its impact on the market price. The project uses Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building the sentiment analysis model. The model was built using two methods, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Random Forest Regression, and was tested with an accuracy of 82% and 86% respectively.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the impact of influencer tweets on the Ethereum market price. To achieve this, the following tasks were performed:
* Data collection using the Twitter API
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Model development using LSTM and Random Forest Regression
* Model evaluation and accuracy testing

## Data Collection
The project collected tweets related to Ethereum using the Twitter API and filtered them to exclude any mentions of anything other than Ethereum. The tweets were collected from influencer Twitter users who were selected based on their popularity and number of followers.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
The collected tweets underwent data preprocessing and feature engineering, which involved cleaning the data and extracting relevant information from it. This was done using the Python programming language and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package.

## Model Development
The sentiment analysis model was built using two methods: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Random Forest Regression. The LSTM model was trained and tested with an accuracy of 82%. The bidirectional LSTM model was also built for optimal results and delivered 84% accuracy. The Random Forest Regressor model offered around 86% accuracy.

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed the impact of influencer tweets on the Ethereum market price. The results showed a strong correlation between the tweets and the market price, and the sentiment analysis model built using LSTM and Random Forest Regression delivered promising accuracy results. The project provides a dependable source of information for cryptocurrency traders and can be updated in the future for optimal results.
